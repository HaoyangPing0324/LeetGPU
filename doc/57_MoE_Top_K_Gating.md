Implement a GPU program that performs Top-K Gating for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Given a logit matrix of shape `[M, E]` where M is the number of tokens and E is the number of experts, identify the k largest values in each row, extract their indices, and apply softmax to get mixing weights.

For each row i, the operation computes: $$ \begin{align} \text{indices}\_i, \text{vals}\_i &= \text{TopK}(\text{logits}\_i, k) \\ \text{vals}\_i &= \text{logits}\_i\[\text{indices}\_i\] \\ \text{weights}\_i &= \text{Softmax}(\text{vals}\_i) \end{align} $$

The selected experts must remain ordered by descending logit value, matching the order returned by `topk`. The `topk_weights` array must correspond positionally to `topk_indices` in that same order.

### Implementation Requirements

- External libraries are not permitted
- The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
- The final result must be stored in the `topk_weights` and `topk_indices` arrays

### Example 1:

    Input:
      logits = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
                [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]]
      M = 2, E = 4, k = 2

    Output:
      topk_weights = [[0.7311, 0.2689],
                      [0.7311, 0.2689]]
      topk_indices = [[3, 2],
                      [0, 1]]

    Explanation:
    Row 0: Top-2 values are 4.0 and 3.0 at indices 3 and 2.
           Softmax([4.0, 3.0]) = [0.7311, 0.2689]
    Row 1: Top-2 values are 4.0 and 3.0 at indices 0 and 1.
           Softmax([4.0, 3.0]) = [0.7311, 0.2689]

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 10,000 (number of tokens)
- 1 ≤ `E` ≤ 256 (number of experts)
- 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `E` (top-k selection, typically k=2)
- All tensors are stored on GPU
- Logits are 32-bit floats
- Indices are 32-bit integers
- Performance is measured with `M` = 1,024, `k` = 2
